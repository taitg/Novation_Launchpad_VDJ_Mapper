01/10/12



To install the mapper:

1. Navigate to your documents folder\VirtualDJ\

2. Move the Novation Launchpad files in Devices and Mappers (in this directory) to the Virtual DJ equivalents

3. Start Virtual DJ




To use the tool:

1. Move lpmaptool.exe to the same directory as the mapper file (Novation Launchpad mapping.xml)

2. Run lpmaptool.exe

3. Click Load Mapper

4. Click a button to select it

5. Modify the actions for the button and its LEDS, click the Save button to make the change permanent

(*) VirtualDJ uses XML, so inside the program:
    " = &quot;
    ' = &apos;
    & = &amp;

       - there are buttons at the upper right so you can copy/paste these for use within the program

(*) This tool is based on the device definition file included, so it must be in the
    Documents\VirtualDJ\Devices folder for any created mapper to work

Enjoy!
